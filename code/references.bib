  abstract = {The neuropathological correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. To study the interaction between A{$\beta$} and tau and their effect on synaptic function, we derived a triple-transgenic model (3\texttimes Tg-AD) harboring PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L transgenes. Rather than crossing independent lines, we microinjected two transgenes into single-cell embryos from homozygous PS1M146V knockin mice, generating mice with the same genetic background. 3\texttimes Tg-AD mice progressively develop plaques and tangles. Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque and tangle pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal A{$\beta$}. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal A{$\beta$} with regards to synaptic plasticity. The recapitulation of salient features of AD in these mice clarifies the relationships between A{$\beta$}, synaptic dysfunction, and tangles and provides a valuable model for evaluating potential AD therapeutics as the impact on both lesions can be assessed.},

  abstract = {A computer-controlled, multiple-channel odor generator, operant test chamber, and discrimination training procedure for mice are described. The odor generator allows controlled presentation of any one or combinations of eight odors to an odor-sampling port that contains a liquid reinforcement delivery tube that also serves to detect responses. A modified discrete trial operant conditioning procedure provides measures of both response accuracy and response rate during anticipation of stimulus delivery and in the presence of two different odor stimuli. Results from numerous experiments demonstrate that, with these methods, mice reliably and rapidly acquire odor detection and a variety of odor-discrimination tasks, and that response rate in the presence of the odor reflects the incentive motivation of stimuli that are or are not associated with reward.},

Olfactory delayed matching-to-sample learning was assessed in male and female 5XFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, and their wildtype (B6SJL F1) littermates at 6\textendash 7 months of age using an operant olfactometer. All 5XFAD and wildtype mice were able to learn the delayed olfactory matching-to-sample task at 2 and 5s delays. Fewer mice learned with a 10s delay and only one mouse learned with a 30s delay. Female mice showed higher levels of performance on the delayed matching-to-sample task than males, indicative of better working memory. These results demonstrate for the first time that mice are able to learn an olfactory delayed matching to sample task.},

  abstract = {Provides a simple and intuitive pipe-friendly framework, coherent with the 'tidyverse' design philosophy, for performing basic statistical tests, including t-test, Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and correlation analyses. The output of each test is automatically transformed into a tidy data frame to facilitate visualization. Additional functions are available for reshaping, reordering, manipulating and visualizing correlation matrix. Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis of factorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs (repeated measures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed 'within-and-between-Ss' designs. It's also possible to compute several effect size metrics, including "eta squared" for ANOVA, "Cohen's d" for t-test and 'Cramer V' for the association between categorical variables. The package contains helper functions for identifying univariate and multivariate outliers, assessing normality and homogeneity of variances.},

  abstract = {The lifespan of mice shows genotype, sex and laboratory effects, but little is known about genotype or sex differences in life expectancy of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper examines the lifespan of males and females of different mouse models of AD and their wildtype strains. Genotype and sex dependent differences in longevity have important implications for designing experiments with Alzheimer's mouse models, comparing genotype and sex differences in aging mouse models, designing drug treatment regimes and the translation of mouse data to human clinical studies. We conclude that the concept of aging and age-related disorders in mice must be reconsidered based on genotype and sex differences in mouse life expectancy data. Use of concepts such as relative age, prospective lifespan and proportion of lifespan remaining should be included in studies of age-related changes in mouse brains and behavior. Finally, measures such as the Frailty Index, which is independent of chronological age might be used to determine a common scale of aging for all mouse strains.},
